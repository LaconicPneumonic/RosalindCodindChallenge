# Description

Solving problems from the [Rosalind Coding Challenge](https://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/) in python. There's a lot of high performance computing problems in this space, so it's a good way to "cross train" for me and likely for others.

## Requirements

1. Python 3
2. Likely a great cpu for some of the less efficient solutions lol
